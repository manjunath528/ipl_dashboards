Here I have created the dashboards for the data that I have previously processed from the snowflake .
Project Overview:

This project involves the creation of interactive Tableau dashboards that provide insights into the analysis of the ipl cricket history and the players historical details. The analysis explores trends, patterns, and other data points that can be used to derive meaningful conclusions about ipl cricket and all about the player details like their performance in the ipl whole history.

Tables are: 
1. Match_Fact ,which includes the complete details about the match.

    1. Provide an interactive and user-friendly way to explore data related to ipl cricket.
    2. Provide the details about the all the players of the ipl cricket .
